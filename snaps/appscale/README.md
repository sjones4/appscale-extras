# Install

You can install this appscale tools snap from:

  https://snapcraft.io/appscale

though it may be easier to use if you install as a classic snap with access to your existing configuration in $HOME/.appscale:

```
# sudo snap install --classic appscale
```

but note that installing with the classic option disables security confinement.


# Usage

Once installed commands are available via the "appscale" command:

```
# appscale init
```
